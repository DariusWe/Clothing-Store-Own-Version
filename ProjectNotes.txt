## FOLDER/APP STRUCTURE

App structure is for the most part based on the structuring that was used in the course. At some places it was changed (for learning
purposes and to better suit my own project). Alongside to the course i have educated myself on other structuring strategies.

 Criteria for a good scaling project:
- low and shallow dependencies between features (as features might be added, modified or deleted in the future)
- keep API logic in a seperate file/folder and create own interfaces to communicate with it.
- intuitive strucutring and naming (you probably won't work alone on the project)


## TOOLING

One can argue that too much tooling was used for this project. The reason for leveraging Redux, Redux Saga, Styled Components and Typescript
here is not necessarily due to a better coding experience, but more for learning purposes.
