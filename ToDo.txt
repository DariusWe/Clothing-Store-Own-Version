- Redux should store the most basic form of data. Selectors then should handle the selecting logic. See Redux chapter of udemy course.
  When selectors include code to extract the information needed, this code is run everytime the selector is run. This can be bad for
  performance, but look at redux chapter (think he has a solution for this). Also useSelector in combination with middleware can lead to
  not wanted rerenderings. This can be solved with Memoization (caching).
  --> Right now my action creator is doing all the fetching and preparing of the data. But should be changed to above strategy.
- Redux should store the most basic form of data. The cart slice right now stores redundant data (total and totalQuantity can be derived
  from the cartItems array). Put the logic for this into selectors.
- useSelect(selector) and dispatch(actioncreator, payload) --> this way you never need to import ACTION_TYPES? More organized maybe.
- research file/folder structuring strategies (React Redux)!
- research render behaviour of my components. Some components are unnecessarily rerendering multiple times. 

- ShoppingCart Price ist confusing. Add the single item price to it.
- Implement global css fonts, color etc. management
- continue WebDev document on google docs 
- Deploying: Learn about whats happening in the background. Learn about this service, it's advantages and disadvantages.
- Build Register-Page and Form
- Commit

- Fetching products from Firestore: Better, more organized solution? Right now super complicated to understand whats happening there...
- Make Responsive

AT THE END:
- Animations and Click-Feedback
- When Cart-Popup open, make dark overlay over rest of site (look c&a)
- Include better images
- More sense-making prices
- Build Mens Page
- Build Collection Category Page
- Build Filter
- Build Wishlist
- Build Product-Page
- Include basic Account Settings



- Make a sticky, changing (on scroll) header, that always shows the most important information.
- Fetching all shop data from the database once and then store it in a context variable? Or is it ineffective to fetch ALL data? Maybe
  just fetch the parts you need? But then you would have to make more queries. What is faster and better? Also: Is it possible to fetch
  just the titles of the categorie documents for the shop page? For the shop page you don't need all the single items.
  Solution for now: As not a lot amount of data, i will fetch it with a single query and store it in a react context variable.
- What happens when database changes? Live updates in the UI? And when should these live updates happen?
- global solution to manage content width of pages
- global solution to manage font family and size

- solved: orderBy in firebase.jsx is not working. Solution: orderBy only working in queries, not in getDocs itself.
