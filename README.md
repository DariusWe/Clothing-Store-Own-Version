# Clothing store built with react and redux

This work-in-progress project was built alongside to the course "Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)" by Zero To Mastery on Udemy for the purpose of learning React and the whole ecosystem around it. It's featuring an online clothing store with a login and signup system (via Firebase) and a firestore database to store products and product-related information. Routing is done with React Router, state management via Redux Toolkit (although i also learned React Context API and Redux Core extensively throughout the project). Redux-persist is used in combination with redux-persist-transform-filter to store global app state in the clients local storage. The whole app is written in Typescript. Styling is done via styled components (i'm not a fan of it and might switch to Tailwind CSS in the future) and SCSS. The app is fully responsive and features animations and transitions created with React Transition Group.

Stripe API to allow payments and some other minor features (for example the product page) will be implemented in the near future.
